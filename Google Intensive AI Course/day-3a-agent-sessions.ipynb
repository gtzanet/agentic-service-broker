It holds immense potential to improve patient outcomes, enhance efficiency, and make healthcare more accessible and personalized.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, the field of drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is making some of its most significant and exciting advancements. Here are some of the newest developments:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) can now *design entirely new molecules* from scratch. These models learn the rules of molecular structure and desired properties (like binding affinity to a target, solubility, or reduced toxicity) and then generate novel chemical structures with a high probability of being effective.\n*   **\"Dreaming Up\" Drugs:** Researchers are using these tools to explore vast chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible, potentially leading to entirely new classes of drugs for challenging diseases.\n\n**2. Accelerating Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Omics Data Integration:** AI is becoming incredibly adept at analyzing complex \"omics\" data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) to identify novel disease targets. By finding patterns that humans might miss, AI can pinpoint specific genes, proteins, or pathways that are implicated in disease and could be amenable to drug intervention.\n*   **Causal Inference:** Moving beyond correlation, AI is being used to understand causal relationships within biological systems, helping researchers validate whether targeting a specific molecule will actually have the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n**3. Enhancing Pre-clinical and Clinical Trial Design:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models can analyze large datasets from previous clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to predict how likely a new drug candidate is to succeed or fail. This can help researchers de-prioritize less promising compounds early on, saving significant time and resources.\n*   **Patient Stratification for Trials:** AI can identify specific patient subgroups that are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This allows for more targeted clinical trials, increasing the chances of success and potentially reducing trial duration.\n*   **Virtual Clinical Trials:** While still nascent, AI is being explored to simulate aspects of clinical trials, potentially reducing the need for some in-person visits or the number of participants required.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze vast databases of existing drugs and disease information to identify new therapeutic uses for approved medications. This is a much faster and cheaper route to new treatments than developing a drug from scratch.\n\n**5. AI-Powered Lab Automation:**\n\n*   **Robotic Screening and Synthesis:** AI is increasingly integrated with robotic platforms to automate high-throughput screening of potential drug candidates and the synthesis of novel compounds. This significantly speeds up the experimental process.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany biotech and pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. Some notable players and areas of focus include:\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its use of generative AI to discover and develop novel drugs, including a drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that has entered clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven drug design and has multiple AI-designed drugs in various stages of clinical development.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for small molecule drug discovery and has partnered with many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies.\n*   **DeepMind (Google's AI Lab):** While not solely focused on drug discovery, their work on protein structure prediction with AlphaFold has profound implications for understanding disease mechanisms and designing drugs.\n\n**Challenges and the Road Ahead:**\n\nDespite these advances, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Availability:** High-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for training accurate AI models.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab and in clinical trials.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** The regulatory frameworks for AI-discovered drugs are still evolving.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model suggests a particular molecule is important for building trust and scientific understanding.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing how we approach it, making the process faster, more efficient, and opening up possibilities for discovering entirely new types of medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in my previous response: **Accelerating Target Identification and Validation.**\n\nThis is a crucial step in drug discovery because before you can develop a drug, you need to know *what* you're trying to target. A \"target\" is typically a molecule (like a protein or gene) within the body that plays a key role in a disease process. By designing a drug that interacts with this target, you aim to disrupt the disease.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n\n**1. Unlocking the Power of \"Omics\" Data:**\n\n*   **The Challenge:** Modern biology generates massive amounts of data from various \"omics\" disciplines:\n    *   **Genomics:** The study of an organism's complete set of DNA.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** The study of all RNA molecules in a cell or organism, showing which genes are active.\n    *   **Proteomics:** The study of all proteins, which are the workhorses of cells.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** The study of all small molecules (metabolites) in a cell or organism.\n    *   **Epigenomics:** The study of changes in gene activity that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence.\n*   **The AI Solution:**\n    *   **Pattern Recognition:** These datasets are incredibly complex and high-dimensional. AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, excels at finding subtle patterns, correlations, and anomalies within these vast amounts of data that human researchers might miss.\n    *   **Identifying Disease Signatures:** By analyzing the \"omics\" profiles of healthy individuals versus those with a specific disease, AI can identify specific genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways that are consistently altered in the disease state. These altered components become strong candidates for drug targets.\n    *   **Network Analysis:** AI can map out complex biological networks, showing how different genes, proteins, and metabolites interact. This helps researchers understand how a particular molecule contributes to disease progression and identify key \"nodes\" within the network that would be most impactful to target.\n\n**2. Moving Beyond Correlation to Causation:**\n\n*   **The Problem with Correlation:** Historically, researchers often relied on identifying correlations (e.g., a protein is found at higher levels in diseased cells). However, correlation doesn't always equal causation. The protein might be elevated *because* of the disease, not *causing* it.\n*   **AI-Powered Causal Inference:** Advanced AI techniques, including causal inference models, are being developed to infer causal relationships. These methods try to disentangle cause and effect by analyzing data from different types of experiments or observational studies.\n*   **Example:** AI might analyze data from gene editing experiments (where a gene is turned off) and compare it to observational data from patients. If turning off a gene consistently leads to disease improvement, and that gene is also found to be highly expressed in diseased patients, AI can provide stronger evidence that this gene is a causal driver of the disease, and therefore a good drug target.\n\n**3. Prioritizing and Validating Targets:**\n\n*   **Ranking Candidates:** Once AI identifies a list of potential targets, it can further help prioritize them based on various criteria, such as:\n    *   **\"Druggability\":** How likely is it that a small molecule or biologic can effectively bind to and modulate this target?\n    *   **\"Dose-Response\" Prediction:** How likely is it that modulating this target will have a significant therapeutic effect?\n    *   **Safety Profile:** What are the potential side effects of targeting this molecule? AI can analyze existing literature and databases for known associations with adverse events.\n*   **Accelerated Validation:** AI can help design experiments that more efficiently validate potential targets. For instance, it can suggest the most informative genetic perturbations or the most relevant cell lines or animal models to test the hypothesis.\n\n**Impact of this Development:**\n\n*   **Faster Identification:** What used to take years of painstaking research can now be done much more rapidly.\n*   **Discovery of Novel Targets:** AI can uncover targets that are obscure or in complex biological pathways that were previously difficult to study.\n*   **Reduced Failure Rates:** By better identifying and validating targets upfront, the overall success rate of drug discovery pipelines can be improved, as fewer drugs will fail later in development due to targeting an irrelevant or non-causal molecule.\n\nThis development is fundamental to the entire drug discovery process. By using AI to more effectively understand the root causes of diseases at a molecular level, researchers can then move on to designing the right drugs to combat them.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about companies specifically focused on **AI-driven target identification and validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
